==============================================
FINAL RESULTS:
- Peak Test Accuracy: 81.35%
- Final Train Accuracy: 79.42%
- Improvement over Baseline XNOR-Net: +11.00%
- Gap to Teacher (87.11%): 5.76%
==============================================

Key Optimizations Applied:
1. Bi-Real Net Residual Connections (preserves gradient flow)
2. Learnable Scaling Factors (adaptive per-channel quantization)
3. Knowledge Distillation from FP32 Teacher (soft target guidance)
